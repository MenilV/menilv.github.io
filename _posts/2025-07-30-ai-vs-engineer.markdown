AI has been a household word for what it seems like eternity but for sure the last 3 years. The biggest milestones - depending on when your interested peaked in the topic of generative models, LLM, ML or just AI in general IMO are the following:

1. GPT-1 released mid 2018 - early adopters were amazed, researchers baffled and [OG - the best dota team in the world: confused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkGa8ICQJS8)
2. GPT-2 released early 2019 - many have started building zero-shot prompts and utilizing many benefits from this model and this was the next step in gaining popularity but not productivity. Not yet! At this point many have started talking about AI and the "wonders" and "doomsdays" of this technology
3. ChatGPT released late 2022 - a full-blown momentum shift for the whole world, the fastest growing userbase in any piece of software and definitely a household name within less then a year.

In the meantime it's worth noting that other companies other then OpenAI have joined the race with their models and innovations, but still there wasn't a clear winner. Each model would trump the previous one, each new innovation would be quickly copied and the only clear winner was a company that didn't even build their own models but instead [`digital shovels`](https://www.nvidia.com/). Regardless, at some point many have started questioning the value of these models in generating images, videos and the "easiest" task: text.

But not just any text, the one text that's not readable to most of the planet ([0.3721% of the population](https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-on-earth-know-computer-programming)) - yes, software code. And this type of generation was easy to train as most of the knowledge lives online, and it's mostly free and accessible. Examples? Yes, Github and any other platform hosting code with public ([and maybe private?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36185372)) repositories was a contributor in training these models.

So - can we enable software engineers with this tool? Can we help newcomers start? Maybe even non-technical people to get into software engineering? Or just replace all of them with agents that write code on their own. Many dissagre on answers. CEO's say models will replace people. Bots/models/agents/AI (call them however you like) will replace faulty humans that need vacations, sick leaves, mistakes to learn, time to eat, time to sleep, time to breathe air.
